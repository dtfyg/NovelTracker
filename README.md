## *Novel Tracker*

As an Avid reader of online webnovels, light novels and novels in general, 
 I want to create this application mainly as a way to track my feelings and progress
through such novels. Because of the way webnovels/light novels usually update
weekly/daily, dropping them temporarily is quite a common occurance for me.
 This application will have a variety of functions that will help to keep
track of these novels including:

- A description of why I dropped the novel including a brief summary of the plot
- A rating system 
- A genre filter function that will allow you to select genres for each novel
- A search function 
- Ranking functions that will sort the list of novels by last read or rating

Aside from myself I think that other webnovel/lightnovel readers will find this
program to be of use in terms of tracking as the system on NovelUpdates,
a commonly used site for tracking novels, makes it a bit clunky and difficult to 
keep track of certain aspects of novels.
